Objectives
Better promote / predict the "Halfway there" product to a wider audience.

Feature Engineering:
Cleaning data (outlier and missing data)
Based on Logit regression, remove all variables that were deemed insignificant based on their p-values. Once finished, check the p-values again to ensure that all variables are still significant.

Model Exploration:
Simple Correlation AnalysisÂ¶
Build several clissification model using the significant set of explanatory variables
Using the Hyperparameter Tuning to optimaize classification model
