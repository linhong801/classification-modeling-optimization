# classification-modeling-optimization

Objectives:
Better promote / predict the "Halfway there" product to a wider audience.

Feature Engineering:
1)Cleaning data (outlier and missing data).
2)Based on Logit regression, remove all variables that were deemed insignificant based on their p-values. Once finished, check 3)the p-values again to ensure that all variables are still significant.

Model Exploration:
1)Simple Correlation Analysis.
2)Build several clissification model using the significant set of explanatory variables.
3)Using the Hyperparameter Tuning to optimaize classification model.
